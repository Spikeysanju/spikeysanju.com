		When people ask me what I do, I tell them I'm a designer and an engineer. Then they give me that
		confused look, and I tell them, "Think of me as a visual mechanic - I fix broken interfaces and
		give them a fresh coat of pixels." My passion for design and engineering is like a marriage - we
		may argue at times, but we always come to a happy resolution. As the founder of my own UX design
		studio, I specialize in taking a user's experience from "meh" to "heck yeah!
